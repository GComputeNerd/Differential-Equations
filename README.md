# Differential Equation Visualizer

This uses another program I made called graphing, to make visualizations of differential equations.

Note:-

In graphing/data.py , A line must be appended of the form

root = <path>

Where <path> is the absolute path to the graphing directory

Example :-

```python
# graphing/data.py

root = '/home/user/Downloads/differential-equations/graphing/'
```
